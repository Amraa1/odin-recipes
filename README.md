# Odin Recipes

### Description
This Project is about creating a food recipe page using html that was taught by Odin Project.
I will learn to make a website and use HTML for web structure.

### Implemented features
Added a main page were you can find each recipes and link to them.
Each recipe pages have their title, description, ingredients, and step-by-step guide.

### Self-reflection
It was amazing to see that my code directly influences my webpage on browser. It was also encouraging to see that within very short amount of time, I was able to make my first website. There are so much to learn and coding is very fun!
